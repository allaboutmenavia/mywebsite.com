	<p>In the year 2003,on the 27th day of May, my mother gave birth to a beautiful little angel in this beautiful world â€” and that's me. Hello everyone! I am Mariela May B. Navia. I am a freshman at Eastern Visayas State University under the Bachelor of Science in Information Tecahnology. My nickname is Meme. From child to now, I am still living in the same address which is Barangay District 29 Nadongholan Ormoc City. 
	Moreover, have you ever asked what's the story behind my name? If yes, don't expect something meaningful. It has nothing special behind it. My parents just collide their names and form a new one. They put May as well because I was born in May. It is an easy peasy.

	We are like just an ordinary family; we can all agree to something but also disagree to other things.</p>

	<p> I have a diverse circle of friends.
	Some of them stayed, while others did not.
 	Despite this, they became a part of my life. 
	It may be sad or happy memory, but they were all memorable.</p>
